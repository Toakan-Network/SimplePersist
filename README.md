## Simple Persist is a server side mod, which requires no additional setup past enabling.

Fully backwards compatible, it does not care what other mods you are using, what you may remove ect during your playtime.

## Features
Currently it will store Player information on Disconnect (Manual abort, crash or Desync) and restore it on Connection:
- Loadout (Vanilla or Modded, supports all armoury loadouts)
- Health (Vanilla or ACE Medical)
- Position

#### SimplePersist not require additional mods, external databases, websites ect.
It doesn't even need CBA_A3 or ACE!

#### Simple Persist is entirely self-contained.
SP retains Player information in the ProfileNamespace. No fancy tricks or back end needed, this means at most you will need to create a new profile when creating a server (or deleting the old profile.vars) in order to make use of this mod.

## Future Plans
There is more to be added in future, such as:
- Vehicles
- Scenic Objects
- Mod compatibilities, IE ACRE channel restore
- Anything else that may come up.

However they are currently on-hold pending some more time for development.
