## Simple Persist is a server side mod, which requires no additional setup past enabling. 

SP will retain Player information in the ProfileNamespace. This means you will need to setup a new profile for each mission you play, otherwise you will end up restoring save data from one map onto a different one. (You can end up in the ocean).

Currently it will store Player information on Disconnect and restore it on Connection:
- Loadout
- Health
- Position

There is more to be added in future, such as:
- Vehicles
- Scenic Objects
However they are currently on-hold pending some more time for development.

This mod was developed for use by 3PARA, a Community MILSIM which aims to provide realistic operations on a weekly basis. If you are interested in joining, please feel free to jump in!

### Please take note, this is not intended to replace ALIVE, RCO Persist or anything else, those mods are more fully featured than this. The aim of this is to provide a simple Player persistence experience.

If you have any questions, or issues, please feel free to reach out on the Workshop.
